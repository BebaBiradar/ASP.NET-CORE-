Creating User Control in ASP.Net:
------------------------------------


XLS and XLSX:
-------------
What is difference XLS and XLSX?
XLSX is a zipped, XML-based file format. Microsoft Excel 2007 and later uses XLSX as the default file format when creating a new spreadsheet. 
Support for loading and saving legacy XLS files is also included. XLS is the default format used with Office 97-2003.

session.abandon
----------------
session.abandon in asp.net core
->Abandon() method destroys all objects stored in a Session object and releases their resources. 
 We call this method in ASP.Net with Session. Abandon(). 
 This method has no parameters and has no return value
->What is the difference between session Clear () and session abandon () in asp net?
 Clearing the session will not unset the session, it still exists with the same ID for the user but with the values simply cleared. 
 Abandon will destroy the session completely, meaning that you need to begin a new session before you can store any more values in the session for that user


.sln file
----------
The .sln file contains text-based information the environment uses to find and load 
the name-value parameters for the persisted data and the project VSPackages it references.
 When a user opens a solution, the environment cycles through the preSolution, Project, 
and postSolution information in the .sln file to load the solution, projects within the solution, 
and any persisted information attached to the solution.


DropDownList's SelectedIndexChanged event not firing
------------------------------------------------------
->I have a DropDownList object in my web page. When I click on it and select a different value, 
  nothing happens, even though I have a function wired up to the SelectedIndexChanged event.

syntax
------
<asp:DropDownList ID="logList" runat="server" 
       onselectedindexchanged="itemSelected">
</asp:DropDownList>


aspx:- The file extension of Web page
ascx:- The file name extension for the user control

Assembly :-An assembly is a file that is automatically generated by the compiler upon successful compilation of every . NET application
->An assembly is a collection of one or more files and one of them DLL or EXE

Session:-A Session can store the value on the Server.
-> It can support any type of object to be stored along with our own custom objects.
-> A session is one of the best techniques
 for State Management because it stores the data as client-based, in other words,
 the data is stored for every user separately and the data is secured also because it is on the server.

ASPX( Active Server Pages Extended ):-
Active Server Pages (ASPX) is a file format used by web servers and generated using the Microsoft ASP.NET framework 
- an open-source development framework used by web developers to create dynamic web pages, 
often with the . NET and C# programming languages.
->ASP . NET is a server-side scripting language. Your .aspx pages are just scripts that tell IIS how to render a page.

Partial class:-
A partial class is a special feature of C#. 
->It provides a special ability to implement the functionality of a single class into multiple
 files and all these files are combined into a single class file when the application is compiled
->This keyword is also useful to split the functionality of methods, interfaces, or structure into multiple files.

HiddenField
-----------
What is a hidden field in HTML?
->The <input type="hidden"> defines a hidden input field. 
  A hidden field lets web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted. 
  A hidden field often stores what database record that needs to be updated when the form is submitted.
->To hide an element, set the style display property to “none”. document. getElementById("element").

Oledbconnection .net core
-------------------------
->An OleDbConnection object represents a unique connection to a data source. With a client/server database system, 
it is equivalent to a network connection to the server. Depending on the functionality supported by the native OLE DB provider, 
some methods or properties of an OleDbConnection object may not be available.

ViewState AND Session state
----------------------------
What is ViewState and session state?
->The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, 
making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end,
making it easy to manage content from this end too. 
ViewState: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level.

Control
---------
->Defines attributes that are specific to user controls (.ascx files) that are used by the ASP.NET page parser and compiler. 
This directive can be used only with (whose source code is contained in .ascx files). For more information about user controls, see ASP.NE

Parameter Class
--------------
->Supports cloning, which creates a new instance of a class with the same value as an existing instance.


ParameterCollection Class
->Namespace:System.Web.UI.WebControls
  Assembly:System.Web.dll
->Provides a mechanism that data source controls use to bind to application variables, user identities and choices, and other data. Serves as the base class for all ASP.NET parameter types.
C#:->public class Parameter : ICloneable, System.Web.UI.IStateManager

Site.Master
------------
->ASP.NET master pages allow you to create a consistent layout for the pages in your application. 
 A single master page defines the look and feel and 
 standard behavior that you want for all of the pages (or a group of pages) in your application. 
 You can then create individual content pages that contain the content you want to display. 
 When users request the content pages, they merge with the master page to produce output that combines the layout of the master page with the content from the content page.
->A master page is an ASP.NET file with the extension .master (for example, MySite.master) with a predefined layout that can include static text, HTML elements, and server controls. 
The master page is identified by a special @ Master directive that replaces the @ Page directive that is used for ordinary .aspx pages. The directive looks like the following.
Syntax:
-------
<%@ Master Language="VB" %>
